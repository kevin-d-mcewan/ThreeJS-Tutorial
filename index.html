            // Our Javascript will go here
            // This is setting up our scene
            const scene = new THREE.Scene();
            // This is setting up our camera. There are different types of cameras we chose PerspectiveCamera
            // The attributes in the Camera are as follows (Field of View/FOV {75}, Aspect Ratio {window.innerWidth
            // / window.innerHeight}, Near Clipping Plane {0.1}, Far Clipping Plane {1000})
            const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );

            // This is setting up the renderer(Where the awesomeness happens)
            const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
            // setSize usually want to do 'width' & 'height' of our area i.e. browser window. For intesnsive apps
            // we want to do smaller i.e. 'window.innerWidth/2' & 'window.innerHeight/2' makes app render 1/4 size
            // can set 3rd argument to 'false' for updateStyle to get size but lower resolution
            renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
            // This adds renderer to element in HTML Doc. In this example is a <canvas> element the renderer uses
            document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

            // Add a Cube to the scene
            // To create cube need 'BoxGeometry'. Object contains all the points[vertices] & fill[faces] of the cube.
            const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
            // This is a material to add color to it. There are many materials. All materials take an object of properties
            // which will be applied to them. For example will only be adding a green color.This works like css colors (hex colors)
            const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00} );
            // 3rd added is 'Mesh'. MESH is an object that takes 'geometry' and adds a 'material' to it. We can add this to
            // the scene and move around freely
            const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
            // By default call 'scene.add()' which adds thing to coordinates (0, 0, 0). This would cause camera and object
            // to be on top of each other. To avoid this move camera out a bit
            scene.add( cube );

            // Moving camera out a bit to not be on top of cube
            camera.position.z = 5;

            // Next we need to RENDER THE SCENE. To do this we need whats called 'render' or 'animate loop'
            // This creates a loop that causes 'renderer' to draw scene every time screen refreshes (typically 60 times per second (60 fps))
            // We use 'requestAnimationFrame' over 'setInterval' bc it has a # of advantages i.e. pausing when user switches tab
            // this saves processing power and batter life
            function animate() {
                requestAnimationFrame( animate );
                renderer.render( scene, camera );
            }
            animate();
